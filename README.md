# I got an exercism!

This repository is where I put my solutions to some tracks in exercism. Since I am practicing some topics in my favorite languages and trying new ones, this is more a backup of repos (for the tracks) than a very active repository.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is a marvelous tool to learn and improve programming skills in a structured way. At this moment they have 55 languages' tracks. Declarative, imperative, functional, logic, procedural and object-oriented.

I really recommend you to visit this site and look if it is suitable to your purposes.
## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and a Business Intelligence Consultant in Mexico. I am writing code for a blockchain Defi startup and enjoying my free time reading and playing my guitar.

I have a degree in Computers Engineering from Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.
## Tracks

At this moment I am just commiting solutions since I do not know the licensing of the testing code. Once I know there is not licensing issues I will update with the test suites and instructions to running them.

### Active

- Julia 
- Nim 

### For future development

- Kotlin
- Clojure
- Go
- Rust
- R
- Python
- Prolog
- Dart
- Haskell
## Run Locally

### Julia

Assuming that you are running a local version

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/greenLogic/exercism.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd exercism/julia/solution_nn
```

Run

```bash
  julia solution_nn.jl
```

#### Installing Julia via jill.py

[jill.py](https://github.com/johnnychen94/jill.py) This is my favorite way to install Julia, since is cross-platform installer.

Note that Python 3.6 is required.

```bash
  pip install jill --user -U
```

Then to install the latest stable release: 

```bash
jill install
```

### Nim

Assuming that you are running a local version

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/greenLogic/exercism.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd exercism/julia/solution_nn
```

Run

```bash
  nim c -r solution_nn.jl
```

#### Installing Nim via choosenim

[choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) this tool help you to install multiple versions and is cross-platform.

Follow the instructions of their repo and then:

```bash
  choosenim stable
```

This installs the latest stable release.
